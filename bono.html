    <h1> BONO REGION </h1>
    <p style="padding: 30px;">The Bono region is one of the 16 administrative regions of Ghana. It is as a result of the remainder of Brong-Ahafo region when Bono East region and Ahafo region were created. Sunyani, also known as the green city of Ghana is the regional capital. Sunyani can pride itself as the cleanest capital city and a major conference destination. The region was created after the Ahafo region and Bono East region respectively have been carved out of the then Brong-Ahafo region. This was in fulfillment of a promise made by candidate Nana Akuffo Addo in his 2016 campaign activities. The implementation of plans for the creation of this region is seeded to the newly created Ministry of Regional Reorganization and Development under the leadership of Hon. Dan Botwe. Brong Ahafo Region in effect ceased to exist and so does the Brong Ahafo Region Co-ordinating Council (BARCC).
Consequently, in the spirit of Article 255 of the 1992 constitution and Article 186 of the Local Governance Act, 2016 (Act 936 as Amended), the Bono Regional Co-ordinating Council (BRCC) is a new entity and thus replaces the BARCC. Because of this, it became necessary to inaugurate the BRCC to enable it to perform its functions accordingly.</p>
